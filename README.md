## About The Project

This project was made for a computer human interaction course at Queen's University. The user is able to create spheres, each with there own individual gravitational pull, by moving their cursor about the window. Particles are free to move and affect each others trajectory, with an attached vector indicating their direction of acceleration.


### Built With

* [Processing](https://processing.org/)


## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

* Downloaded the Processing IDE and have the Java libraries installed

## Configuration

Load the .pde file in and run!

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have any improvements, bug fixes, or feature suggestions, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request.
